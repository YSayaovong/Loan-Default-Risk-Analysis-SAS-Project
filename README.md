# 📊 Loan Default Risk Analysis (SAS Project)

This project uses **SAS OnDemand for Academics** to perform a full analysis of a loan dataset and identify key factors that contribute to loan default. It includes **data import**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **logistic regression modeling**, and **visualization** of risk trends.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SAS OnDemand for Academics**
- SAS Base Programming (PROC IMPORT, PROC MEANS, PROC FREQ, PROC LOGISTIC)
- SAS Visual Analytics (PROC SGPLOT)
- CSV Data Source: `loan_risk_data.csv`
